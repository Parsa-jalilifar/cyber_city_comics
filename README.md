## Coding Case Study

Cyber City Comics is one of the fastest growing comic book stores in downtown Toronto since 1990s. However,
the digital revolution in publishing industry in the last 15 years had forced the bookstore to look for creative way
to attract more customers.  Cyber City Comics decided to partner with comic publishers and create the following
online application in the next 3 days:

#### Objective:
Create a web server hosted on Heroku that serves web pages that display xkcd web comic strips.
Requirements:
- Use the xkcd API (see https://xkcd.com/json.html)
- Has to be hosted on Heroku
- Has to be done in Javascript without Jquery
- Homepage displays the latest comic
- Display 1 comic strip per page
- Buttons to navigate to the previous and next comic strip
- Display the date of when the comic strip was created
- Ability to navigate to a specific comic strip by including the comic # in the URL
- Parse transcript from API into a more readable format & display on the page
- Make the page look nice using vanilla CSS (DO NOT use any CSS frameworks)

#### Bonus:
- A random button that goes to a random comic strip
- Make the site responsive
- Each comic page has a counter that displays the amount of times this specific comic strip has been viewed on your site
